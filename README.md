This project is a **GUI-based AES-256 File Encryption and Decryption Tool** built using Python's `tkinter` library and the `PyCryptodome` cryptographic package. It provides a simple yet secure interface for users to encrypt and decrypt sensitive files using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm in **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)** mode. The tool derives a strong 256-bit encryption key from the user-provided password using the **PBKDF2 key derivation function** with a random salt and 1,000,000 iterations, enhancing resistance against brute-force attacks. During encryption, the selected file's content is padded, encrypted, and saved with a `.enc` extension, while the decryption process reverses this by verifying the password and restoring the original content with a `.dec` extension. The application also ensures confidentiality by incorporating a random IV (Initialization Vector) and proper padding handling. Featuring an intuitive GUI for file selection and password input, this project is ideal for beginners and intermediate developers looking to understand practical file-level encryption and user authentication security, making it a useful tool for protecting personal or confidential data on local machines.
